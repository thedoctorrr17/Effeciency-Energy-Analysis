## Data Understanding
* Relative Compactness: This is the relative compactness of the building, which is defined as the ratio of the building's volume to the volume of an equivalent cuboid that encloses the building. This variable ranges from 0.62 to 0.98.
* Surface Area - m²: This is the total surface area of the building, including walls, roof, and windows. 
* Wall Area - m²: This is the total area of the building's walls. 
* Roof Area - m²: This is the total area of the building's roof.
* Overall Height - m: This is the height of the building. 
* Orientation = 2:North
                3:East
                4:South
                5:West
  This is the orientation of the building. The values 2, 3, 4, and 5 represent North, East, South, and West orientations, respectively.
* Glazing Area - 0%, 10%, 25%, 40% (of floor area): This is the total glazing area of the building, expressed as a percentage of the floor area. 
* Glazing Area Distribution (Variance) - 1:Uniform, 2:North, 3:East, 4:South, 5:West: This is the distribution of glazing area across the building. The values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 represent a uniform distribution and North, East, South, and West distributions, respectively.
* Heating Load - kWh/m²: This is the heating load of the building, expressed in kilowatt-hours per square meter. 
* Cooling Load - kWh/m²: This is the cooling load of the building, expressed in kilowatt-hours per square meter.
